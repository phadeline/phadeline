- 👋 Hi, my name is @phadeline and I'm a software engineer who fell in love with coding in the summer of 2022. I was always interested in coding, but I 
always thought that it wasn't meant for me because I didn't see a lot of black female engineers. But in the summer of 2022, I decided to take a leap of faith and started teaching myself HTML, CSS and Javascript. Eventually, I enrolled in Rutgers Coding Fullstack Coding Bootcamp and will graduate in April 2023. 

- 👀 I’m interested in hiking and volleyball. I enjoy taking walks at the park and binge watching netflix shows. I'm taking swimming classes and 
hope one day to be able to go the beach and actually swim in the ocean insteadof just sticking my toes in. I also, want to go snorkeling 
one day *fingers crossed*
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript. It's a difficult process so far but I know it will be worth it in future. Software Development 
has provided me with the ability to make my imaginations come to life and I want the opportunity to share that with everyone through Github. In the 
future, I want to expand my skills and learn other languages like Python and Java.
